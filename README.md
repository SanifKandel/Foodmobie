  <strong>
  Repository Pattern
  </strong>
  <p>
  The repository pattern is a popular software design pattern that separates the application's data access layer from the business logic layer. In this pattern, data is accessed through repositories, which are responsible for querying the data and returning it in a form that can be easily used by the application. The business logic layer interacts with the repositories to access the data without having to worry about how the data is retrieved or stored.

By following the repository pattern, the FoodMobie app separates the logic of data access and manipulation from the business logic layer. This makes the code easier to understand, test, and maintain. Additionally, the repository pattern helps to promote code reusability and ensures that the application remains scalable as it grows.

In the context of the FoodMobie app, the repository pattern is implemented using classes such as FoodRepository, ReminderRepository, and RecipeRepository. These classes are responsible for managing data related to foods, reminders, and recipes, respectively. By using these repositories, the application can easily query and manipulate data without having to know the details of how the data is stored and retrieved.
